## Background

Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

  As a recently hired data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Our first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
  
  In this assignment, we will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, we are to perform:

  1. Data Engineering

  2. Data Analysis

My final results included the following files:

- QuickDBD-table schema.txt
- QuickDBD-export.sql
- QuickDBD-export.png
- Table_Schema.sql
- Queries.sql
- SQL_Challenge_Bonus.ipynb
